# TreeMaker

I have developed this small application program for another project. It's raw and I made it for fun. But maybe you'll need it.
Maybe it will be better in the future.

**makeTree.py** creates a tree. Commands:
`add node` -- create new node according to the node name and the parent name
`remove node` -- remove the node according to the node name
`show` -- print the tree\n"+
`save`-- save the tree to the file"
